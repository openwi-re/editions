### The Long Read
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-sh/Thoughts_Chairman_Xi **The thoughts of Chairman Xi**: "There aren’t many 21st Century leaders who lived in a cave and laboured as a farmer before clawing their way to power. Now President Xi Jinping’s second five-year term as leader will be confirmed at the Chinese Communist Party Congress. He leads a confident, rising superpower, but one which jealously polices what is said about its leaders."
